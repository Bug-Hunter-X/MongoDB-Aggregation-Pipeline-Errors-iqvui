# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Errors

This repository demonstrates common errors encountered when using MongoDB's aggregation pipeline and provides solutions to address them. Aggregation pipelines are powerful for data processing, but unexpected input or logical flaws can lead to incorrect results or errors. 

The `bug.js` file showcases a sample pipeline prone to errors. The `bugSolution.js` file contains corrections and improved error handling.

**Common Errors Addressed:**

* **Unexpected data types in grouping fields:** The `$group` stage might fail if the grouping field contains inconsistent or unexpected data types.
* **Logical errors in query conditions:** Incorrect query conditions in the `$match` stage can lead to unexpected results or empty results.
* **Performance issues with complex pipelines:** Very complex pipelines can lead to performance problems.

This example focuses on practical error scenarios. Please refer to the MongoDB documentation for comprehensive information on aggregation pipeline syntax and best practices.
